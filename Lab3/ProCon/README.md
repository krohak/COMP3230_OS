#Sample program of producer consumer problem implemented with semaphore   
	Reference: https://github.com/angrave/SystemProgramming/wiki/Synchronization,-Part-3:-Working-with-Mutexes-And-Semaphores   
	Note that since there's no critical parts in the sample program (just printf()), Mutex is not used in this program. It's good for you to learn how to make critical session thread safe in this way.      
    
##Compile   
	Just run make   
   
##Run
	./proCon.out
